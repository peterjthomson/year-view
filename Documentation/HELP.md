## Getting Started

### Granting Calendar Access

When you first open Year View, you'll be asked to grant access to your calendars. This permission allows Year View to display your events.

**To grant access:**

1. Tap **Allow** when prompted, or
2. Go to **Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars → Year View** and enable access

Year View uses **read-only** access—it can display your events but cannot modify them. All event creation and editing is done through your native Calendar app.

### What You'll See

Once calendar access is granted, Year View automatically loads all your calendars and displays the current year. Today's date is highlighted, making it easy to orient yourself.

---

## The Main View

The main screen shows your entire year with events displayed as colored dots or bars (depending on your chosen layout). Each event's color matches its calendar.

### Understanding the Display

- **Today** is highlighted with your accent color
- **Event indicators** appear as colored dots or bars under each date
- **Up to 3 event colors** are shown per day (when there are more events, the most prominent calendars are displayed)
- **Weekend days** can have a different background shade for easy identification

---

## Layout Options

Year View offers **five different layouts** to suit your preferences. Switch between them using the layout buttons at the bottom of the screen (iOS) or in the toolbar (Mac).

### 1. Year View (Continuous Weeks)

**Icon:** Calendar

The default view shows the entire year as continuous week rows, similar to a traditional year planner. Events appear as horizontal bars spanning their duration.

**Best for:** Seeing how events span across weeks, identifying busy periods, and planning around multi-day events.

### 2. Month Rows

**Icon:** Stacked rectangles

Each month is displayed as a single horizontal row, with all days laid out in sequence. The weekday columns align across all months.

**Best for:** Comparing the same weekdays across different months, seeing month-to-month patterns.

### 3. Grid View

**Icon:** 3×3 grid

A traditional 4×3 grid showing all 12 months in a familiar calendar format. Each month displays in a compact grid with weeks as rows.

**Best for:** A classic calendar overview, quickly finding specific dates.

### 4. Row View (Horizontal Scroll)

**Icon:** Horizontal bars

Months are arranged in a horizontally scrollable row. Swipe left and right to move through the year.

**Best for:** Focusing on one month at a time while maintaining year context.

### 5. List View

**Icon:** Bullet list

A vertical scrolling list of months, each displayed as a complete month grid.

**Best for:** Scrolling through the year on narrow screens, detailed month-by-month review.
