**See the big picture of your life.**

Year View transforms how you see your calendar. Instead of scrolling through weeks and months, see your entire year on a single screen. Spot patterns, find free time, and plan ahead with unprecedented clarity.

**A companion, not a replacement.**

Year View works alongside Apple Calendar and the calendars you connect there (including Google). We don't try to replace your existing calendar—we enhance it. Tap any event to open it in your native calendar app. Creating a new event? We'll take you right there.

**Six beautiful ways to view your year:**

• **Month Rows** — Calendar.app-style month strips
• **Year View** — Continuous week rows across the year
• **Grid View** — The classic 4×3 layout showing all 12 months
• **Row View** — Scroll horizontally through months like a timeline
• **List View** — Months stacked vertically for quick scanning
• **Power Law** — Multi-horizon panels from today to the year

**Works with all your calendars:**

Year View sees every calendar you've connected to Apple Calendar—iCloud, Google, Outlook, Exchange, and more. Toggle calendars on and off to focus on what matters.

**Everywhere you are:**

• iPhone — Your year in your pocket
• iPad — The full year visible without scrolling
• Mac — Menu bar access for quick glances

**Privacy first:**

Your calendar data stays on your device. No accounts required. No tracking. No analytics. Just you and your calendar.
